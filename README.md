### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name's Igor Halfeld and I'm a problem solver building [Ext. Contabilidade Online](https://extcontabilidade.com.br/?coupon=igorluizhalfeld@gmail.com), I was by three years Microsoft MVP, and I have been organizing Vue.js SP since 2017. (I also organized a 2-day conference called Vue.js Summit in 2018, a Node.js (@nodebr) and Javascript (@jssp) group at Sao Paulo)

I enjoy creating products, and addicted to the philosophy of build&learn in public. Recently created [storyseed.pro](https://storyseed.pro/) and [leanhackers.club](https://leanhackers.club/).

Storyseed is an app that let you create content for your social network or blog in minutes with ChatGPT.

Lean hackers is a paid community to talk about startups, tech and product.

I've been in the technology field for over 10 years and creating products within startups for over 8 years.

I've worked with several technologies between backend, frontend and mobile. The languages I currently mostly use are Javascript, Golang and Python.

I also create content (pt-br) on [YouTube daily](https://www.youtube.com/@igorhalfeld), and do [lives on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/igorhalfeld), on tuesdays and thursdays.

Do you have any ideas about startups, tech or products? Send me a DM on my Twitter
