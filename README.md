### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **Software Engineer focused on Front-end engineering and architecture** and I'm building stuff at [TradersClub(TC)](https://tc.com.br/), Microsoft MVP, Organizer at Vue.js Summit, Vue.js Brazil, Vue.js SP, JSSP, NodeBR.

I really enjoy studying the engineering behind the Front End, I love understanding how the Browser works and how Javascript is parsed. Love to share knowledge and contribute to free software.
